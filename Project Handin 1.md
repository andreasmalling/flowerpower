# Project Handin 1 #
## Getting started ##
The first handin should get you started using the tools. This handin has two goal:

- To write a static HTML page that can serve as a template for the web shop.
- To become familiar with Tomcat and to be able to host static files on a publicly available server.

### Assignment ###
First of all your web shop needs a proper design template to attract customers and to present your products. The first task is to write a static HTML page that looks like your web shop will do in the end of the course. Your HTML page should present at least a couple of products in some kind of list or table where you can add more products later.

Make your HTML page available on a running Tomcat server on one of the fresh-horse machines (use the guide to create an SSH tunnel to fh.cs.au.dk).

Hand in a zip file containing your HTML and CSS files along with other relevant resources (such as images if any). Also include a README.txt where you indicate where your server is running so that your TA can see the page in action.

### Grading of the handin ###
The handin will be graded based on the following criteria:

- Whether the HTML is valid according to either the HTML 4 strict or HTML5 specification.
- Whether the page is shown correctly (looks the same way) in both Chrome and Internet Explorer.
- To what degree CSS is used for styling the page.
- Whether it is publicly available on a Tomcat server.

Up to 10 points are awarded for this handin.
